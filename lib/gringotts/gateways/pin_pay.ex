defmodule Gringotts.Gateways.PinPayments do
  @moduledoc """
  [PinPayments][home] gateway implementation.

  The login credentials are:

  | Key      | Credentials        |
  | ------   | --------           |
  | username | `api_key`          |


  The following features of PinPayments are implemented:

  | Action                       | Method        |
  | ------                       | ------        |
  | Authorize                    | `authorize/3` |
  | Capture                      | `capture/3`   |
  | Purchase                     | `purchase/3`  |
  | Store                        | `store/2`     |
  | Refund                       | `refund/3`    |


  ## The `opts` argument

  Most `Gringotts` API calls accept an optional `keyword` list `opts` to supply
  optional arguments for transactions with the PinPayments gateway. The following keys
  are supported:

  | Key               | Type       | Remark                                           |
  | ----              | ----       | ---                                              |
  | `address`         | `map`      | The address of the customer                      |
  | `email_id`        | `String.t` | Merchant provided email addres                   |
  | `description`     | `String.t` | Merchant provided description of the transaction |
  | `ip_address`      | `String.t` | Merchant provided ip address (optional)          |


  > PinPayments supports more optional keys and you can raise [issues] if
    this is important to you.

  ### Schema

  * `address` is a structure from Gringotts.Address , and include any
    of the keys from:

    `[:street1, :street2, :city, :region, :postal_code, :country, :phone ]`


  ## Registering your PinPayments account at `Gringotts`

  | Config parameter | PinPayments secret    |
  | -------          | ----                  |
  | `:username`      | `**API_SECRET_KEY**`  |

  > Your Application config **must include the `:username`
  > fields** and would look something like this:

      config :gringotts, Gringotts.Gateways.Pinpay,
          username: "your_secret_key",
          

  * PinPayments **does** process money in cents.
  * Although PinPayments supports payments various cards. This module only
  accepts payments via `VISA`, `MASTER`, and `AMERICAN EXPRESS`.

  ## Supported countries
  PinPayments supports the countries listed 
  * Australia
  * New Zealand

  ## Supported currencies
  PinPayments supports the currencies listed [here](https://pinPayments.com/developers/api-reference/currency-support)



  ## Following the examples

  1. First, set up a sample application and configure it to work with Monei.
  - You could do that from scratch by following our [Getting Started][gs] guide.
  - To save you time, we recommend [cloning our example
  repo][example] that gives you a pre-configured sample app ready-to-go.
  + You could use the same config or update it the with your "secrets"
          as described [above](#module-registering-your-monei-account-at-PinPay).

  2. Run an `iex` session with `iex -S mix` and add some variable bindings and
  aliases to it (to save some time):
  ```
  iex> alias Gringotts.{Response, CreditCard, Gateways.Pinpay}
  iex> card = %CreditCard{first_name: "Jo",
                          last_name: "Doe",
                          number: "4200000000000000",
                          year: 2099, month: 12,
                          verification_code: "123", brand: "VISA"}
  ```

  We'll be using these in the examples below.

  Creates a new charge and returns its details.

  The authorization validates the `card` details with the banking network,
  places a hold on the transaction `amount` in the customerâ€™s issuing bank.


  PinPayments returns a **Token Id** which can be used later to:
  * `capture/3` an amount.

  a sample `card`.

  Captures a previously authorised charge and returns its details. 

  `amount` is transferred to the merchant account by PinPayments used in the

  Transfers `amount` from the customer to the merchant.

  Stores the payment-source data for later use.

  PinPayments can store the payment-source details, for example card or bank details
  which can be used to effectively process _One-Click_ and _Recurring_ payments,

  * _One-Click_ and _Recurring_ payments are currently not implemented.
