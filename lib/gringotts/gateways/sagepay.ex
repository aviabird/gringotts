defmodule Gringotts.Gateways.SagePay do
  @moduledoc """
  [sagepay][home] gateway implementation.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Most `Gringotts` API calls accept an optional `Keyword` list `opts` to supply
  optional arguments for transactions with the gateway.

  The following features of SagePay are implemented:

  | Action                       | Method        | 
  | ------                       | ------        | 
  | Authorize                    | `authorize/3` | 
  | Release                      | `capture/3`   | 
  | Refund                       | `refund/3`    | 
  | Reversal                     | `void/2`      | 
  | Purchase                     | `purchase/3`  | 

  [home]: sagepay.co.uk
  [docs]: integrations.sagepay.co.uk

  ## The `opts` argument

  Most `Gringotts` API calls accept an optional `keyword` list `opts` to supply
  [optional arguments][extra-arg-docs] for transactions with the MONEI
  gateway. The following keys are supported:

  | Key                      |
  |  ---------------         |
  |  [`merchant_id`]         |
  |  [`vendor`]              |
  |  [`vendorTxcode`]        |  
  |  [`transactionType`]     |  
  |  [`customerFirstName`]   |  
  |  [`customerLastName`]    |  
  |  [`billingAddress`]      |  
  |  [`transaction_id`]      |    


  ## Registering your SagePay account at `Gringotts`

  After [making an account on SagePay][dashboard], head to the dashboard and find
  your account "secrets" in the `Sub-Accounts > Overview` section.

  Here's how the secrets map to the required configuration parameters for SagePay:

  | Config parameter        | SagePay secret         |
  | ------------------------| -----------------------|
  | `:auth_id`              | **Authorization Id**   |
  | `:vendor_name`          | **Name of a merchant** |

  Your Application config **must include the `:Authorization Id`, `:Merchant name`
  fields** and would look something like this:

      config :gringotts, Gringotts.Gateways.SagePay,
        auth_id: "your_secret_user_id",
        vendor_name: "name_of_vendor"
        

  ## Scope of this module

  * SagePay does not process money in cents, and the `amount` is converted to integer.
  * SagePay supports payments from various cards and banks.

  ## Supported currencies and countries

      :AUD, :CAD, :CHF, :CYP, :DKK, :EUR, :GBP, :HKD, :INR, :JPY, 
      :MTL, :NOK, :NZD, :RUB, :SEK, :SGD, :THB, :TRY, :USD, :ZAR 

  ## Following the examples

  1. First, set up a sample application and configure it to work with SagePay.
  - You could do that from scratch by following our [Getting Started][gs] guide.
      - To save you time, we recommend [cloning our example
      repo][example] that gives you a pre-configured sample app ready-to-go.
          + You could use the same config or update it the with your "secrets"
          as described [above](#module-registering-your-sagepay-account-at-gringotts).

  2. To save a lot of time, create a [`.iex.exs`][iex-docs] file as shown in
     [link][sagepay.iex.exs] to introduce a set of handy bindings and
     aliases.

  We'll be using these in the examples below.

  @doc """
  Performs a (pre) Authorize operation.

  The authorization validates the `card` details with the banking network,
  places a hold on the transaction `amount` in the customerâ€™s issuing bank.

  SagePay returns an trancaction ID string which can be used to:
  * `capture/3` an amount.
  * `void/2` abort deferred transaction.
  * `refund/3` an amount.

  ## Note

  * The merchantSessionKey expires after 400 seconds and can only be used to create one successful card identifier. 
  * It will also expire and be removed after 3 failed attempts to create a card identifier.
  * vendorTxCode in opts should always be unique.

  ## Example

  The following example shows how one would (pre) authorize a payment of $42 on
  a sample `card`.
