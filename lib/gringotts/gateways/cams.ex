defmodule Gringotts.Gateways.Cams do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
    A module for working with the Cams payment gateway.
    
    You can test gateway operations in [CAMS API TEST MODE](https://secure.centralams.com).
    Test it using these crediantials **username:** `testintegrationc`, **password:** `password9`,
    as well as you can find api docs in this test account under **integration** link.

    The following features of CAMS are implemented:

    | Action                       | Method        |
    | ------                       | ------        |
    | Authorize                    | `authorize/3` |
    | Capture                      | `capture/3`   |
    | Purchase                     | `purchase/3`  |
    | Refund                       | `refund/3`    |
    | Cancel                       | `void/2`      |

  ## The `opts` argument

    Most `Gringotts` API calls accept an optional `Keyword` list `opts` to supply
    optional arguments for transactions with the Cams gateway. The following keys
    are supported:
  
    | Key                 | Remark | Status          |
    | ----                | ---    | ----            |
    | `billing_address`   |        | Not implemented |
    | `address`           |      	 | Not implemented |
    | `currency`          |        | **Implemented** |
    | `order_id`  				|        | Not implemented |
    | `description`       |        | Not implemented |

    All these keys are being implemented, track progress in
    [issue #42](https://github.com/aviabird/gringotts/issues/42)!

  ## Configuration parameters for Cams:

    | Config parameter | Cams secret   |
    | -------          | ----          |
    | `:username`      | **Username**  |
    | `:password`      | **Password**  |
  
  > Your Application config **must include the `:username`, `:password`
  > fields** and would look something like this: 
   
      config :gringotts, Gringotts.Gateways.Cams,
      adapter: Gringotts.Gateways.Cams,
      username: "your_secret_user_name",
      password: "your_secret_password",
  

  ## Scope of this module, and _quirks_

  * Cams process money in cents.
  * Although Cams supports payments from electronic check & various cards this library only 
  accepts payments by cards like *visa*, *master*, *american_express* and *discover*.

  ## Following the examples
  1. First, set up a sample application and configure it to work with Cams.
      - You could do that from scratch by following our [Getting Started](#) guide.
      - To save you time, we recommend [cloning our example
  repo](https://github.com/aviabird/gringotts_example) that gives you a
  pre-configured sample app ready-to-go.
          + You could use the same config or update it the with your "secrets"
          that you get after registering with Cams.

  2. Run an `iex` session with `iex -S mix` and add some variable bindings and
  aliases to it (to save some time):
  ```
  iex> alias Gringotts.{Response, CreditCard, Gateways.Cams}
  iex> opts = [currency: "USD"] # The default currency is USD, and this is just for an example.
  iex> payment = %CreditCard{number: "4111111111111111", month: 11, year: 2018,
                            first_name: "Longbob", last_name: "Longsen",
                            verification_code: "123", brand: "visa"}
  ```

  We'll be using these in the examples below.

    Authorize a credit card transaction.

    The authorization validates the `card` details with the banking network, places a hold on the
    transaction amount in the customerâ€™s issuing bank and also triggers risk management. 
    Funds are not transferred.It needs to be followed up with a capture transaction to transfer the funds 
    to merchant account.After successful capture, transaction will be sent for settlement.
    
    Cams returns an `authorization` which can be used later to:
    * `capture/3` an amount.
    * `void/2` a authorized transaction.
