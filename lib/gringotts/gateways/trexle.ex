  [Trexle][home] Payment Gateway implementation.

  > For further details, please refer [Trexle API documentation][docs].

  Following are the features that have been implemented for the Trexle Gateway:

  | Action                       | Method        |
  | ------                       | ------        |
  | Authorize                    | `authorize/3` |
  | Purchase                     | `purchase/3`  |
  | Capture                      | `capture/3`   |
  | Refund                       | `refund/3`    |
  | Store                        | `store/2`     |

  ## The `opts` argument

  Most `Gringotts` API calls accept an optional `keyword` list `opts` to supply
  optional arguments for transactions with Trexle. The following keys are
  supported:

  * `email`
  * `ip_address`
  * `description`

  [docs]: https://docs.trexle.com/
  [home]: https://trexle.com/

  ## Registering your Trexle account at `Gringotts`

  After [creating your account][dashboard] successfully on Trexle, head to the dashboard and find
  your account "secrets" in the [`API keys`][keys] section.

  Here's how the secrets map to the required configuration parameters for MONEI:

  | Config parameter | Trexle secret   |
  | -------          | ----            |
  | `:api_key`       | **API key**     |

  Your Application config must look something like this:

      config :gringotts, Gringotts.Gateways.Trexle,
          api_key: "your-secret-API-key"

  [dashboard]: https://trexle.com/dashboard/
  [keys]: https://trexle.com/dashboard/api-keys

  ## Scope of this module

  * Trexle processes money in cents.**citation-needed**.

  ## Supported Gateways

  Find the official [list here][gateways].

  [gateways]: https://trexle.com/payment-gateway

  ## Following the examples

  1. First, set up a sample application and configure it to work with Trexle.
  - You could do that from scratch by following our [Getting Started][gs] guide.
      - To save you time, we recommend [cloning our example repo][example-repo]
        that gives you a pre-configured sample app ready-to-go.
        + You could use the same config or update it the with your "secrets"
          that as described
          [above](#module-registering-your-trexle-account-at-gringotts).

  2. To save a lot of time, create a [`.iex.exs`][iex-docs] file as shown in
     [this gist][trexle.iex.exs] to introduce a set of handy bindings and
     aliases.

  We'll be using these bindings in the examples below.

  Performs a (pre) Authorize operation.

  The authorization validates the `card` details with the banking network,
  places a hold on the transaction `amount` in the customerâ€™s issuing bank and
  also triggers risk management. Funds are not transferred.

  Trexle returns a "charge token", avaliable in the `Response.authorization`
  field, which can be used in future to perform a `capture/3`.

  ### Example

  The following session shows how one would (pre) authorize a payment of $100 on
  a sample `card`.

  ```

  Captures a pre-authorized `amount`.

  `amount` is transferred to the merchant account by MONEI when it is smaller or
  equal to the amount used in the pre-authorization referenced by `charge_token`.

  Trexle returns a "charge token", avaliable in the `Response.authorization`
  field, which can be used in future to perform a `refund/2`.

  ## Note

  Multiple captures cannot be performed on the same "charge token". If the
  captured amount is smaller than the (pre) authorized amount, the "un-captured"
  amount is released.**citation-needed**

  ## Example

  The following example shows how one would (partially) capture a previously
  authorized a payment worth $10 by referencing the obtained `charge_token`.

  ```
  iex> amount = Money.new(10, :USD)
  iex> token = "some-real-token"
  iex> Gringotts.capture(Gringotts.Gateways.Trexle, token, amount)

  Transfers `amount` from the customer to the merchant.

  Trexle attempts to process a purchase on behalf of the customer, by debiting
  `amount` from the customer's account by charging the customer's `card`.

  one-shot, without (pre) authorization.

  Refunds the amount to the customer's card with reference to a prior transfer.

  Trexle processes a full or partial refund worth `amount`, referencing a
  previous `purchase/3` or `capture/3`.

  Trexle returns a "refund token", avaliable in the `Response.authorization`
  field.

  Multiple, partial refunds can be performed on the same "charge token"
  referencing a previous `purchase/3` or `capture/3` till the cumulative refunds
  equals the `capture/3`d or `purchase/3`d amount.

  The following session shows how one would refund $100 of a previous
  `purchase/3` (and similarily for `capture/3`s).
