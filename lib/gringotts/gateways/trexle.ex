  After creating your account successfully on [Trexle](https://docs.trexle.com/) follow the [dashboard link](https://trexle.com/dashboard/api-keys) to fetch the secret api_key.

  Your Application config must look something like this:

      config :gringotts, Gringotts.Gateways.Trexle,
          adapter: Gringotts.Gateways.Trexle,
          api_key: "Secret API key",

  Captures a particular amount using the charge token of a pre authorized card.

  The amount specified should be less than or equal to the amount given prior to capture while authorizing the card.
  If the amount mentioned is less than the amount given in authorization process, the mentioned amount is debited.
  Please note that multiple captures can't be performed for a given charge token from the authorization process.

  ### Example
  ```
  iex> amount = 100

  iex> token = "charge_6a5fcdc6cdbf611ee3448a9abad4348b2afab3ec"

  Refunds the amount to the customer's card with reference to a prior transfer.

  Trexle processes a full or partial refund worth `amount`, referencing a
  previous `purchase/3` or `capture/3`.

  Multiple refund can be performed for the same charge token from purchase or capture done before performing refund action unless the cumulative amount is less than the amount given while authorizing.

  ## Example
  The following session shows how one would refund a previous purchase (and similarily for captures).
  ```
  iex> amount = 5
