  * description

  ## Trexle account registeration with `Gringotts`
  After creating your account successfully on [Trexle](https://docs.trexle.com/) follow the [dashboard link](https://trexle.com/dashboard/api-keys) to fetch the secret api_key.

  Your Application config must look something like this:

      config :gringotts, Gringotts.Gateways.Trexle,
          adapter: Gringotts.Gateways.Trexle,
          api_key: "Secret API key",
          default_currency: "USD"

  Captures a particular amount using the charge token of a pre authorized card.

  The amount specified should be less than or equal to the amount given prior to capture while authorizing the card.

  Refunds the amount to the customer's card with reference to a prior transfer.

  Trexle processes a full or partial refund worth `amount`, referencing a
  previous `purchase/3` or `capture/3`.

  Multiple refund can be performed for the same charge token from purchase or capture done before performing refund action unless the cumulative amount is less than the amount given while authorizing.
