  ## The `opts` argument

  Most `Gringotts` API calls accept an optional `keyword` list `opts` to supply
  [optional arguments][extra-arg-docs] for transactions with the MONEI
  gateway. The following keys are supported:

  | Key                      | Remark                                                                                        |
  | ----                     | ---                                                                                           |
  | [`billing`][ba]          | Address of the customer, which can be used for AVS risk check.                                |
  | [`cart`][cart]           | **Not Implemented**                                                                           |
  | [`custom`][custom]       | It's a map of "name"-"value" pairs, and all of it is echoed back in the response.             |
  | [`customer`][c]          | Annotate transactions with customer info on your Monei account, and helps in risk management. |
  | [`invoice_id`][b]        | Merchant provided invoice identifier, must be unique per transaction with Monei.              |
  | [`transaction_id`][b]    | Merchant provided token for a transaction, must be unique per transaction with Monei.         |
  | [`category`][b]          | The category of the transaction.                                                              |
  | [`merchant`][m]          | Information about the merchant, which overrides the cardholder's bank statement.              |
  | [`register`][t]          | Also store payment data included in this request for future use.                              |
  | [`shipping`][sa]         | Location of recipient of goods, for logistics.                                                |
  | [`shipping_customer`][c] | Recipient details, could be different from `customer`.                                        |

  ## Registering your MONEI account at `Gringotts`

  After [making an account on MONEI][dashboard], head to the dashboard and find
  your account "secrets" in the `Sub-Accounts > Overview` section.

  Here's how the secrets map to the required configuration parameters for MONEI:

  | Config parameter | MONEI secret   |
  | -------          | ----           |
  | `:userId`        | **User ID**    |
  | `:entityId`      | **Channel ID** |
  | `:password`      | **Password**   |

  Your Application config **must include the `:userId`, `:entityId`, `:password`
  fields** and would look something like this:

      config :gringotts, Gringotts.Gateways.Monei,
        userId: "your_secret_user_id",
        password: "your_secret_password",
        entityId: "your_secret_channel_id"

  [dashboard]: https://dashboard.monei.net/signin

  ## Scope of this module

  * _You, the merchant needs to be PCI-DSS Compliant if you wish to use this
    module. Your server will recieve sensitive card and customer information._
  * MONEI does not process money in cents, and the `amount` is rounded to 2
    decimal places.
  * Although MONEI supports payments from [various][all-card-list]
    [cards][card-acc], [banks][bank-acc] and [virtual accounts][virtual-acc]
    (like some wallets), this library only accepts payments by [(supported)
    cards][all-card-list].

  [all-card-list]: https://support.monei.net/charges-and-refunds/accepted-credit-cards-payment-methods
  [card-acc]: https://docs.monei.net/reference/parameters#card
  [bank-acc]: https://docs.monei.net/reference/parameters#bank-account
  [virtual-acc]: https://docs.monei.net/reference/parameters#virtual-account

  ## Supported countries

  MONEI supports the countries listed [here][all-country-list]

  ## Supported currencies

  MONEI supports the currecncies [listed here][all-currency-list], and ***this
  module*** supports a subset of those:

      :AED, :AFN, :ANG, :AOA, :AWG, :AZN, :BAM, :BGN, :BRL, :BYN, :CDF, :CHF, :CUC,
      :EGP, :EUR, :GBP, :GEL, :GHS, :MDL, :MGA, :MKD, :MWK, :MZN, :NAD, :NGN, :NIO,

  ## Following the examples

  1. First, set up a sample application and configure it to work with MONEI.
      - You could do that from scratch by following our [Getting Started](#) guide.
      - To save you time, we recommend [cloning our example repo][example-repo]
        that gives you a pre-configured sample app ready-to-go.
        + You could use the same config or update it the with your "secrets"
          that you see in `Dashboard > Sub-accounts` as described
          [above](#module-registering-your-monei-account-at-gringotts).

  2. To save a lot of time, create a [`.iex.exs`][iex-docs] file as shown in
     [this gist][monei.iex.exs] to introduce a set of handy bindings and
     aliases.

  We'll be using these bindings in the examples below.

  @doc """
  Performs a (pre) Authorize operation.

  The authorization validates the `card` details with the banking network,
  places a hold on the transaction `amount` in the customerâ€™s issuing bank and
  also triggers risk management. Funds are not transferred.

  MONEI returns an ID string which can be used to:

  * `capture/3` _an_ amount.
  * `void/2` a pre-authorization.

  ## Note

  * The `:register` option when set to `true` will store this card for future
    use, and you will recieve a registration `token` in the `:token` field of
    the `Response` struct.
  * A stand-alone pre-authorization [expires in
    72hrs](https://docs.monei.net/tutorials/manage-payments/backoffice).

  ## Example

  The following example shows how one would (pre) authorize a payment of $42 on
  a sample `card`.

      iex> amount = Money.new(42, :USD)
      iex> card = %Gringotts.CreditCard{first_name: "Harry", last_name: "Potter", number: "4200000000000000", year: 2099, month: 12, verification_code:  "123", brand: "VISA"}

  Captures a pre-authorized `amount`.

  `amount` is transferred to the merchant account by MONEI when it is smaller or

  ## Note

  MONEI allows partial captures and unlike many other gateways, does not release
  the remaining amount back to the payment source. Thus, the same
  pre-authorisation ID can be used to perform multiple captures, till:
  * all the pre-authorized amount is captured or,
  * the remaining amount is explicitly "reversed" via `void/2`. **[citation-needed]**

  Stores the payment-source data for later use.

  MONEI can store the payment-source details, for example card or bank details

  The registration token is available in the `Response.id` field.

  It is recommended to associate these details with a "Customer" by passing
  customer details in the `opts`.

  ## Voiding a previous authorization

  MONEI will reverse the authorization by sending a "reversal request" to the
  payment source (card issuer) to clear the funds held against the
  authorization. If some of the authorized amount was captured, only the
  remaining amount is cleared. **[citation-needed]**

  ## Voiding a previous purchase

  MONEI will reverse the payment, by sending all the amount back to the
  customer. Note that this is not the same as `refund/3`.

  ## Example

  The following example shows how one would void a previous (pre)
  authorization. Remember that our `capture/3` example only did a partial
  capture.
