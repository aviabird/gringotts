defmodule Gringotts.Gateways.Stripe do
  @moduledoc """
  Stripe gateway implementation. For reference see [Stripe's API documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api).
  The following features of Stripe are implemented:

  | Action                       | Method        |
  | ------                       | ------        |
  | Pre-authorize                | `authorize/3` |
  | Capture                      | `capture/3`   |
  | Refund                       | `refund/3`    |
  | Reversal                     | `void/2`      |
  | Debit                        | `purchase/3`  |
  | Store                        | `store/2`     |
  | Unstore                      | `unstore/2`   |

  ## The `opts` argument
  Most `Gringotts` API calls accept an optional `Keyword` list `opts` to supply
  optional arguments for transactions with the Stripe gateway. The following keys
  are supported:

  | Key                    | Status           |
  | ----                   | ----             |

  | `capture`              | **Implemented**  |
  | `description`          | **Implemented**  |
  | `metadata`             | **Implemented**  |
  | `receipt_email`        | **Implemented**  |
  | `shipping`             | **Implemented**  |
  | `customer`             | **Implemented**  |
  | `source`               | **Implemented**  |
  | `statement_descriptor` | **Implemented**  |
  | `charge`               | **Implemented**  |
  | `reason`               | **Implemented**  |
  | `account_balance`      | Not implemented  |
  | `business_vat_id`      | Not implemented  |
  | `coupon`               | Not implemented  |
  | `default_source`       | Not implemented  |
  | `email`                | Not implemented  |
  | `shipping`             | Not implemented  |

  ## Note

  _This module can be used by both PCI-DSS compliant as well as non-compliant
  merchants!_

  ### I'm not PCI-DSS compliant

  No worries, both `authorize/3` and `purchase/3` accept a
  "payment-source-identifier" (a `string`) instead of a `CreditCard.t`
  struct. You'll have to generate this identifier using [Stripe.js and
  Elements][stripe-js] client-side.

  ### I'm PCI-DSS compliant

  In that case, you need not use [Stripe.js or Elements][stripe-js] and can
  directly accept the client's card info and pass the `CreditCard.t` struct to
  this module's functions.

  ## Registering your Stripe account at `Gringotts`

  After [making an account on Stripe](https://stripe.com/), head
  to the dashboard and find your account `secrets` in the `API` section.

  ## Here's how the secrets map to the required configuration parameters for Stripe:
  | Config parameter | Stripe secret  |
  | -------          | ----           |
  | `:secret_key`    | **Secret key** |

  Your Application config must look something like this:

      config :gringotts, Gringotts.Gateways.Stripe,
          secret_key: "your_secret_key",
          default_currency: "usd"
  """

  @base_url "https://api.stripe.com/v1"

  use Gringotts.Gateways.Base
  use Gringotts.Adapter, required_config: [:secret_key]

  alias Gringotts.{Address, CreditCard, Money, Response}

  @doc """
  Performs a (pre) Authorize operation.

  The authorization validates the card details with the banking network,
  places a hold on the transaction amount in the customerâ€™s issuing bank and
  also triggers risk management. Funds are not transferred.

  Stripe returns an `charge_id` which should be stored at your side and can be
  used later to:
  * `capture/3` an amount.
  * `void/2` a pre-authorization.

  ## Note
  Uncaptured charges expire in 7 days. For more information, [see authorizing
  charges and settling
  later](https://support.stripe.com/questions/can-i-authorize-a-charge-and-then-wait-to-settle-it-later).

  ## Example
  The following session shows how one would (pre) authorize a payment of $10 on
  a sample `card`.

      iex> card = %CreditCard{
            first_name: "John",
            last_name: "Smith",

          }

          address = %Address{
            street1: "123 Main",
            city: "New York",
            region: "NY",

            postal_code: "11111"
          }

      iex> opts = [currency: "usd", address: address]
      iex> amount = 10

      iex> Gringotts.authorize(Gringotts.Gateways.Stripe, amount, card, opts)

  Transfers amount from the customer to the merchant.

  Stripe attempts to process a purchase on behalf of the customer, by debiting
  amount from the customer's account by charging the customer's card.

  ## Example
  The following session shows how one would process a payment in one-shot,
  without (pre) authorization.

      iex> card = %CreditCard{
            first_name: "John",
            last_name: "Smith",

  Captures a pre-authorized amount.

  Amount is transferred to the merchant account by Stripe when it is smaller or
  equal to the amount used in the pre-authorization referenced by `charge_id`.

  ## Note
  Stripe allows partial captures and release the remaining amount back to the
  payment source. Thus, the same pre-authorisation `charge_id` cannot be used to
  perform multiple captures.

  ## Example
  The following session shows how one would (partially) capture a previously
  authorized a payment worth $10 by referencing the obtained `charge_id`.

      iex> id = "ch_1BYvGkBImdnrXiZwet3aKkQE"
      iex> amount = 5

  @doc """
  Voids the referenced payment.

  This method attempts a reversal of the either a previous `purchase/3` or
  `authorize/3` referenced by `charge_id`.
  As a consequence, the customer will never see any booking on his
  statement.

  ## Voiding a previous authorization
  Stripe will reverse the authorization by sending a "reversal request" to the
  payment source (card issuer) to clear the funds held against the
  authorization.

  ## Voiding a previous purchase
  Stripe will reverse the payment, by sending all the amount back to the
  customer. Note that this is not the same as `refund/3`.

  ## Example
  The following session shows how one would void a previous (pre)
  authorization. Remember that our `capture/3` example only did a partial
  capture.

      iex> id = "ch_1BYvGkBImdnrXiZwet3aKkQE"

  @doc """
  Refunds the amount to the customer's card with reference to a prior transfer.

  Stripe processes a full or partial refund worth `amount`, referencing a
  previous `purchase/3` or `capture/3`.

  ## Example
  The following session shows how one would refund a previous purchase (and
  similarily for captures).

      iex> amount = 5

  Stores the payment-source data for later use.

  Stripe can store the payment-source details, for example card which can be
  used to effectively to process One-Click and Recurring_ payments, and return a
  `customer_id` for reference.

  ## Example
  The following session shows how one would store a card (a payment-source) for
  future use.
