# Changelog

## [`v1.1.1-rc`][tag-1_1_1-rc] (2018-06-04)

### Core
Remove the protocol implementation for `ex_money` since they implement it for us
[e1cb32](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/commit/e1cb325a28a8318864ff1cbfbbb67574379a82c0).

### Gateways
- Refactored `Paymill`. Added missing API functions.
- Remove support of [Wirecard](http://wirecard.com/) as it fails to meet the
  standards of this library and it is not at all usable. It is being archived
  in [`wirecard`](https://github.com/aviabird/gringotts/tree/wirecard) branch.

## [`v1.1.0`][tag-1_1_0] (2018-04-22)

### Core
* Introduces the `Gringotts.Money` protocol ([#71][pr#71])
  - Deprecates use of `floats` for money amounts, see [#62][iss#62] for
    motivation.
* Removes payment worker! No application, no worker as per the community's
  [suggestion][joses-feedback] ([#118][pr#118]).

### Miscellaneous
* Introduces `Response.t` ([#119][pr#91]).
* Adds a useful mix task `gringotts.new` ([#78][pr#78]) to help with adding more
  gateways!
* Adds changelog, contributing guide ([#117][pr#117]).
